# Math-Practice-Website
Hello, this is Math Ibex. I wanted to make this website to make an easier UI for kids to practice math.

To run website open up terminal an first run `Git clone https://github.com/some0ne14/mathibex.com.git`

Go into the folder by running `cd Math-Ibex`

Then go into the sub folder by running `cd Math-Ibex-Stable` again

Then run `pip install requirements.txt`

Finally run `python3 main.py`

And click on the local link in the console automatically this will run on port 8000 but this can be changed in main.py

Note this is still is developement and feel free to report any bugs on GitHub and if you are intrested we are looking for collaborators

(This is not a fully secure version and will not be used in the final product)
